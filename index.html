      On a laboratory bench in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a stack of polished
      cylinders of black-coloured concrete sit bathed in liquid and entwined in
      cables. To a casual observer, they aren't doing much. But then Damian
      Stefaniuk flicks a switch. The blocks of human-made rock are wired up to
      an LED â€“ and the bulb flickers into life.
